Billy by Shel Silverstein

Billy loves me,
Billy cares,
Billy picks me peaches and pears.
Billy offers me candy and Cokes,
Billy listens and laughs at me jokes.
Billy helps when I get in a fight,
Billy does all my homework at night.
Billy misses me,
Billy cries,
Billy thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Billy is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Billy just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Billy's hand,
In the darkness where Billy usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Billy's gone!
